__Cycle__  
_The best rides are the ones where you_  
_bite off much more than you can chew,_  
_and live through it._  
_- Doug Bradbury -_

## Overview
Cycle is a game where the players try to cut each other off using cycles that leave a trail behind them.

## Rules
Cycle is played according to the following rules.

- Players can move up, down, left and right...
    - Player one moves using the W, S, A and D keys.
    - Player two moves using the I, K, J and L keys.

- Each player's trail grows as they move.
- Players try to maneuver so the opponent collides with their trail.
- If a player collides with their own or their opponent's trail...
    - A "game over" message is displayed in the middle of the screen.
    - The cycles turn white.
    - Players keep moving and turning but don't run into each other.

## Getting Started
Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer installed and running on your machine. Open a terminal and browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.

python3 cycle or py cycle

You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE and open the project folder. Select the main module inside the dice folder and click the "run" button.

## Project Structure
The project files and folders are organized as follows:
```
root                    (project root folder)
+-- cycle               (source code for game)
  +-- game              (specific classes)
    +-- casting         (classes who are used to make the interactable objects in the game)
    +-- directing       (classes who direct the sequence of actions in the play)
